        <h4>First Test</h4>
        <p>In the first Test at Edgbaston, Smith scored 144, the first century of the series, which was his 24th Test century in his 118th inningsâ€”making him the second-fastest to score 24 Test centuries only behind Don Bradman. In the second innings of the first Test, Smith scored his tenth century in the Ashes and his 25th century in Tests.</p>
        <h4>Second Test</h4>
        <p>In the first innings of the second Test his innings was paused on 80 when he was hit with a 148.7 km/h ball to the left side of his neck, under the ear, but returned to the match after passing the concussion tests and was lbw for 92. On 18 August 2019, Smith was replaced by Marnus Labuschagne on day five of the second Test, after Smith suffered a concussion on the previous day. Therefore, Labuschagne became the first player to become a concussion substitute in a Test match following a change in the International Cricket Council's (ICC) rules.</p>
        <h4>Third Test</h4>
        <p>He was ruled out of third Test with concussion.</p>
        <h4>Fourth Test</h4>
        <p>In the first innings of the fourth Test at Old Trafford Smith scored his third double-century in Test matches and third century in the series and became the first batsman to score 500 or more runs in three successive Ashes series. In the second innings he scored rapid 82 runs from 92 balls.</p>
